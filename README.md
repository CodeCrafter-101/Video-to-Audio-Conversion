# Video to Audio Conversion
## Definition
- Video to Audio Conversion is a simple Python-based utility that extracts audio content (in formats like `.mp3`, `.wav`) from video files (e.g., `.mp4`, `.mkv`, `.avi`). This can be useful for creating podcasts, music clips, voiceovers, or simply extracting background audio from any video file.
## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Required libraries:
  -  `moviepy` (for video and audio handling)
  -  `os` (built-in)
- Install the required package:
  - ````
    pip install moviepy
    ````

## Notes
- Make sure your video file is not corrupted.
- Ensure the `output/` directory exists or is created by the script.
- For long videos, conversion might take time depending on file size.
